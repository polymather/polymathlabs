                    <h3 class="h2">What are Bootcamps</h3>
                    <p>A developer bootcamp is an educational workshop intended to
                       turn novices into functional programmers, no pun intended (Don't
                       worry, you'll get it later). Bootcamps are led by expert developers
                       and normally run from 8-12 weeks, where attendees focus on practical, real-world 
                       skills that will aide them in finding employment upon completion.

                    <p>The most highly-regarded bootcamps focus on current techonologies, so attendees gain
                        a skill-set that will be relevant and marketable to employers. Attendees learn to
                        code while working on projects in a collaborative setting with other
                        developers. This is designed to mimic how developers normally work in the real-world --
                        on teams.

                    <p>After the smartphone became a thing, bootcamps sprang up
                        like wildfire. Many bootcamp alum have changed their lives by becoming developers,
                        but thousands have left bootcamps and floundered, unable to find employment or
                        advance their practice. See, employers know that just because Joe Schmoe attends a
                        bootcamp, does not a developer make.

                    <p>To re-enforce your skills, you will also engage in project-based sprints in collaboration with other 
                        bootcamp attendees. Each project will present a different application to build, and your confidence 
                        will soar as you work on a team, meet deadlines, and ship code. You will learn while doing what developers 
                        for the trendiest startups and tech savvy corporations do. Because soon, you will be them.

                    <p>The costs of reputable bootcamps can reach 20,000 and beyond! Whoah... now we're talking 
                        about serious debt, not to mention complicated (gulp) financing. Not with Polymath. With the 75%
                        early-bird discount, our bootcamp comes in at a cool $1200. You will not find THIS much workshop, 
                        at THIS low price. It is equivalent to invading a country, then looting and plundering its 
                        priceless treasures!

                        It is our hope that this will give flexibility to those who want to learn an in-demand, exciting
                        new skill without ending up in the poor house.

                        and would like to broaden your horizons after work? We've got you covered! It is our aim to make your

                        proficient developer, is a mentor. Mentoring sessions with the Polymath staff are included in your costs,
                        and are designed to help you fulfill your potential. Feedback is important, but the proper feedback
                        is critical. Having seasoned mentors who know what you're thinking, can anticipate your needs, and can identify your
                        weaknesses, is worth its wait in gold. Bullion anyone?

                        makes the process a lot smoother and more enjoyable. Let's be honest, you will have questions, you will 
                        have doubt, and you will struggle to grasp concepts. But then you realize, there are others in the same 
                        boat. So you grab a paddle, communicating and coordinating as you row, and move towards your destination,
                        together.

                        to the value you receive from a Polymath Labs bootcamp, it may as well be 100 pennies! Would you spend $10,000 on

                            utmost importance. The sheer amount of material covered on a weekly basis will literally blow 
                            your mind! Missing a session is not recommended, so choose your session wisely. Preferrably, one 
                            that you foresee being in sync with your weekly routine.

                        a payment of at least $100 dollars is needed 7 days before the 5th session. No exceptions.
                        <span class="asterisk">*</span>Preference will be given to individuals that pay the full bootcamp cost of $1200 up front.

                    <p>So you've had a look at the dates and locations. Now, compare and contrast how the dates sync with your personal 
                        schedule. Once you feel comfortable that you can commit to the bootcamp, click the 'Pre-register Now!' button at the bottom 
                        of the page to launch the pre-registration form. On to step 2!

                        necessary to move forward with registration. All correspondence before your bootcamp start date will be

                    <p>The moment of truth has arrived. This is where you decide which day you will be devoting 3 hours of your life to
                        for the next 12 weeks. You will have the option of choosing from 7 sessions and three different locations. Keep in 
                        mind that registration preference will be given to those who pay in full.

                    <p>The alternate session will be your second-most preferred session. Think of it as fallback that is not what you 
                        wanted, but still works with your schedule. As much as possible will be done to accomodate your first choice, but having 
                        a second option is never a bad idea.

                    <p>The option is provided to choose a preferred location. This matters because demand will drive bootcamp locations. If the Decatur 
                        bootcamp is not filled with the minimum number of attendees, bootcamp will not be held there. This means your preferred location is 
                        not guaranteed, but you may still reserve a spot at another location by completing registration.

                        confirm your spot via a link in the email. This email is the key to completing your registration
                        so it is imperative that you respond.
